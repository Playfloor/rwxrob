job: &job >-
  💰 I work for TEKSystems (!tek) as a full-time Kubernetes cloud native
  infrastructure engineer and software developer (!dev) for
  a well-paying multinational corporation (!dox) supporting thousands of
  high performance machine learning compute nodes.

work: *job

jobs: &jobs >-
  💰 According to US Bureau of Labor and Statistics and job boards (like
  Indeed) the Fastest growing jobs (not just in tech) are 1) security
  analyst, 2) cloud-native infrastructure engineer, and 3) software
  developer. All of them have starting salaries over $100k and all
  require !linux and !coding skills that we go over during !boost

dev: &dev >-
  💻 I prefer "software developer" or "coder" over "engineer" (which is
  illegal to call yourself in Canada without specific schooling). I've
  written thousands of lines of code a dozen or so different languages
  running on millions of systems including most of the Fortune 100.
  While computer science has its place, my work has always been
  practical.

coder: *dev

tek: >-
  🤝 TEKSystems is one of the largest recruiting tech contract work
  companies. You work for TEK, but TEK equally works for you. Unlike
  other companies, you are their customer and their product. You makes
  20-40% less, but they are financially motivated to have your back,
  keep you happy, and find your next gig. The independence is worth it.

vi: &vi >-
  😎 I use Vim (aliased to vi) because I want to be productive quickly
  on *any* UNIX-like (!unix) system and I prefer to leverage the full
  power of !UNIX !filters over bloated, non-portable plugins. These days
  I build all my filters into my !go !Bonzai command tree that I can
  take anywhere with me and use for scripting as well. (See !ed !neovim
  !emacs !vscode)

vim: *vi

editor: *vi

editors: *vi

ed: >-
  💻 Ed is the "standard editor" and although people joke about it, it
  is worth using. Every time you use : in vi/m you are using ex (the newer
  version of ed). Every time you use sed you are using ed. Ed leverages
  the !UNIX !filter philosophy to the fullest. !editor

emacs: >-
  💻 emacs is a fine editor if you use the same system to do your
  editing. It's a horrible editor if you want to edit files on multiple,
  different UNIX systems without installing anything. You also cannot
  use emacs to certify in anything. I prefer !vim with very few plugins
  (as do most hackers and ops people).

vscode: >-
  💻 vscode (from Microsoft) is an my favorite graphical editor, but
  I prefer a universal terminal editor like !vim which can do things
  VSCode users can't even dream of by implementing the !UNIX shell into
  the development process by using !filters over plugins.

unix: >-
  💻 Way before there was !linux, UNIX existed. The UNIX philosophy is
  the reason UNIX beat every other serious operating system. Not many
  people know that Apple macOS is the largest UNIX distro in the world.
  "Do one thing well, and make it integrate" is the UNIX philosophy.
  UNIX !filters are the most powerful, functional approach to the
  terminal and !editor.

filter: &filter >-
  💻 A !UNIX filter is a functional approach to command line piping of
  the output of one command into input of another. Using this method any
  program, small script or large application, can integrate seamlessly
  with everything else. The !vim "filter" command is an exclamation mark
  (!). It is the single most powerful command in all of !vim. Learn it!
  https://rwx.gg/vimagic

filters: *filter

neovim: &neovim >-
  💩 Neovim is shit. Mostly because it has no fucking clue what the
  !UNIX philosophy is about or for. Don't ruin yourself by learning it.
  Learn !vim and how to !filter properly.

about: &about >-
  🔎 I'm Rob Muhlestein, an !engineer, !coder by !trade and !polyglot,
  !grayhat, !mentor and !FOSS contributor when not working. I live in
  Mooresville, North Carolina, USA in an apartment while my !wife
  completes her !art residency in Charlotte.  I choose not to dox my
  company so I can talk about it without disclaimers.  Yes, people from
  work know and watch the stream sometimes. Please don't dox. (Also
  !email !gh !zet !job !project !boost)

info: *about
dox: *about

foss: &foss >-
  🐧 Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) powers the world these days.
  The device you are using right now likely contains significant work
  from FOSS contributors --- especially !Apple computers, which are
  entirely built on "darwin" !BSD !UNIX.

opensource: *foss

conduct: &conduct >-
  😊 My personal code of conduct (which I regularly fail to keep).  My
  main life mantra is "don't get mad, get busy" (because I get mad all
  the fucking time). I guess it is my version of "be the change you want
  to seen in the world".  https://github.com/rwxrob/zet/tree/main/20210502120622

mad: *conduct
sad: *conduct
mean: *conduct

faang: >-
  💩 FAANG is shit. It means nothing. Hell, Microsoft (!ms) isn't even
  included that's how fucking stupid the term is. People who willfully
  use it are morons. Facebook (!fb) doesn't belong, at all. MANGA is cooler,
  but still, look for more than these companies, so many companies are
  BETTER on most every objective level.

mute: &mute >-
  🙊 Mute just means I'm not using my microphone usually because I'm
  focused (!focused) and working on something and speaking breaks the
  flow (!flow). Occasionally, I'll beak the silence (when raided to say
  hello, for example).

voice: *mute

facebook: &facebook >-
  💩 Facebook got famous ranking women's faces against one another
  without their consent. It deliberately promoted illegal use to
  children under 12 ("whales") using their parents credit cards. It
  hires experts in neurological addiction and deliberately incites
  violence for money. It's  popular with hate mongers and manipulators
  (like Putin) to blow up civil society, divide families, and bring us
  to war. If you use it YOU are a part of the problem. I don't.

fb: *facebook

music: &music >-
  🎧 https://www.last.fm/user/rwxrob and !song for music. Want something
  added to the playlist? Just find a link to the song on Spotify and
  post it in chat. Happy to take requests.  I have HackerYoga,
  BeachConcert, Industrial, Chillhop, Synthwave, CoffeeHouse and Piano
  Jazz. I don't really listen to more than that on stream.

playlist: *music

flow: >-
  🤔 Getting in the !flow is something that got popular with techie Cal
  Newport's completely unscientific (but probably correct) book 'Deep
  Work'. Breaking someone's flow is a cardinal sin at most tech shops.
  Keeping a flow is nearly impossible on Twitch, nearly. Using pomodoro
  helps (!pomo).

pomo: &pomo >-
   🍅 ding dong, time to take a 12 pomo break! ❓ Pomodoro method means
   focusing on something intensely then taking a regular break.  Our
   sessions are 54 minutes long since Twitch gives us free,
   uninterrupted time if we take a 12 minute break. Nobody wants an add
   to interrupt them during their flow, right? (!flow) Read more at
   https://github.com/rwxrob/pomo, or add to your own Bonzai tree (!bonzai)

bonzai: &bonzai >-
  🌳 https://github.com/rwxrob/bonzai Bonzai™ is a unique command
  compositor with recursive tab completion that I create to replace
  !shell scripts with a single, portable !go multicall, command tree
  binary that I can curl onto anything. I use it for everything (!z).
  Want to learn  to make your own?  Be sure to catch the Beginner Boost
  on May 4th (!boost).

z: >-
  🌳 https://github.com/rwxrob/z is my !bonzai composite command tree,
  something I invented. I'm migrating my !bash and !perl !shell scripts
  to it so I have a portable, single collection of commands I can use
  anywhere. Plus because !go, my code is useable in other !work and
  !foss projects so I'm not wasting time porting.

boost: &boost >-
  ⚡ https://github.com/rwxrob/boost The SKILSTAK Beginner Boost™ is an
  annual free, live, tech series focused on helping people get (and
  keep) infrastructure engineering jobs. We start Wednesday May the 4th
  at 11:11:11 and have weekly live five-hour sessions most every
  Saturday with AMA on Sundays. See GitHub for prereqs, outline, and
  previous Boosts.

musician: >-
  🎼 I've loved music my whole life but never been good enough to make
  money at it. I was a Madrigal in high-school and in percussion
  emsemble. I learned guitar in college to get chicks. It worked. I did
  open mics in Second Life and later in real life, mostly Jack Johnson
  and beach stuff.

focus: &focus >-
  🤔🎧 I'm focused right now to stay in the flow (!flow). Best way to
  communicate is send a chat message that I'll maybe eventually read --
  especially if you have a Q at the beginning. Catch me on my break
  (!pomo). I might talk then. Please chat away though, others here might
  be able to answer your questions. Also look up the !commands.

focused: *focus

search: &search >-
  ❓ I search from the command line using three commands 'duck' (?) or
  'google' (??) or 'bing' (???) which open the results in my highly
  customized lynx (!lynx) browser. This means my command line history
  becomes my search history, which I search using Vim mode ('set -o
  vi').

lynx: &lynx >-
  😼 Lynx (the text-based web browser) in vi mode is the fastest way to
  do web research. I pity graphic web browser users --- especailly
  hackers --- who haven't learned it. Need a graphic browser?  Just hit
  comma (,) to open it. There's no tracking and text is consistent so
  your eyes remain focused and able to scan at maximum speed. Watch me
  if you're not convinced. Start with w3m if Lynx is too much at first.
  https://github.com/rwxrob/lynx

web: *lynx
browser: *lynx

fish: &fish >-
  🐟 The fishies are the ancient !Perl asciiquarium script that has been
  modified (by @qmacro) to have !rwx on one of the fish and uses
  transparent background (instead of black). You can get a copy under
  "scripts" in my !dot files.

dot: >-
  💥 https://github.com/rwxrob/dot Here are my "dotfiles" (which are
  named that because configuration files on !UNIX and !Linux usually
  start with a dot in your home directory.) I include a bunch of scripts
  in there as well even though I am moving most of them into my !z
  !bonzai tree.

help: >-
  😃 I'm happy to help when and if I can, but often I just can't. We
  like to help people help themselves. If you haven't even done miminal
  research expect to be gently mocked. (It's just fucking rude.)
  Otherwise, ask with a Q and someone will maybe help you out. You can
  also ask in our !discord where you will have a better chance of
  getting help. If you are asking us to do your homework or hack
  someone, forget it.

name: &name >-
  🔒 The 'rwx' in my name means 'read, write, execute' and refers to the
  UNIX/Linux permissions on any file or directory. But RWX is also
  a personal recipe for learning and success: 'read, research', 'write
  about it', and 'experiment, explore, experience'. There's no better
  learning methodology, grounded in pragmatism. !boost

rwx: *name

beej: >-
  📕 http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/ Beej's Guide to Network Programming is
  one of the best resources any developer should ever read. It covers
  things that are not intuitive to beginners like proper UNIX file locking.

started: >-
  🐣👶 I started !coding at 11 on the only Atari 400 at school coding
  BASIC making !dnd character generation programs I dropped coding for most of
  my teen years and picked up again in my 20s in college where I taught
  myself HTML from by reading RFCS (!rfc) and learned Pascal before changing
  majors from CS to !Russian.

dnd: >-
  🐉 I played tons of Dungeons and Dragons. I credit it for a lot of
  what I've been able to do since. It helps with problem-solving and
  creativity. I created huge campaigns and hoped to work for TSR one
  day. I had hundreds of hand-painted figures and did some of my own art
  for the game. I was obsessed with Boris Vallejo and Dungeon Magazine
  (I was really hornt).

russian: >-
  The Cold War ended while I was in college and I majored in Russian.
  I was a cruise director and tour guide in Moscow, St.  Petersburg, and
  Ukraine and made deep friendships (and enemies) while there. I have
  *many* stories including traveling with an arms dealer on the train,
  translating for mob bosses, and being body guard to Samatha Fox.
  I deeply love the Russian people.

rfc: >-
  📗 An IETF RFC is what specifies how the Internet works. Reading them
  can be very illuminating.

go: &go >-
  💻💨 https://github.com/rwxrob/awesome-go Go is the language of cloud
  native computing and my personal favorite. You can get shit done
  quickly and safely in it which is why it was picked for Docker,
  Kubernetes, Prometheus, Helm, and so many more massive applications
  with huge impact and designed by the tech-gods Thompson/Pike/Greisemer
  (also involved in creating UNIX, C, and Unicode) to meet real needs at
  Google. It was specifically designed to replace Java/Python/C/C++.

golang: *go

coding: &coding >-
  💢 The term "coding" includes things that most people do not consider
  to be "programming". It's a more colloquial as well. I've coded in
  more than a dozen languages (!codelangs) at this point. Coding is
  a fundamental part of *any* tech job. Don't let anyone tell you
  differently. (See also !project !started.)

programming: *coding

codelangs: >-
  💢 I have coded markdown yaml json protobuf !go bash perl dockerfile
  makefile awk python peg !pegn hcl rego html css sql javascript ruby
  abnf ebnf typescript deno coffeescript toml ini c cpp csharp graphql
  uml pug stylus php java actionscript hypercard lsl haskel basic.
  I want to learn erlang and lisp and hate !rust.

zig: >-
  🤷 People like Zig. It's intriguing, but will never be significant.
  I found using *any* identifier variation (underscores, hyphens,
  dashes, mixed case) a particularly cool (and at the same time stupid)
  design decision. Wasted compile time is a silly over site. People
  never think about code in the millions of lines. Zig would crash and
  burn.

anton: >-
  💻 Yes, "anton" is a Silicon Valley (!sv) reference. !gilfoyle

sv: &sv >-
  📺 Silicon Valley is one of my favorite shows out there. It satirizes
  Silicon Valley in a way that makes me cry laughing. The show it full
  of Easter eggs for those looking. !Gilfoyle is one of my favorite
  characters of all time.

gilfoyle: >-
  😎 Gilfoyle is from the Silicon Valley (!sv) show. Watch the "what the
  fuck do I do" YouTube video about Gilfoyle. It's perfect.  I aspire to
  be a !Gilfoyle and named my VM !anton in his memory. I love the
  Gilfoyle (ops) vs Dinesh (apps) dynamic which mirrors my experience
  working in both sides of tech.

siliconvalley: *sv

sleep: >-
  🥱💤 I do sleep. I promise. I refuse to work when I'm sleepy. I've
  made too many critical errors in the past from lack of sleep. That
  means I sleep at random times other than the regular stuff.  I get two
  or three maximized brain-power times per day by taking strategic naps
  and have been doing this since I was a triathlete at Nike. !schedule

terminal: &terminal >-
  💻 I use a slightly darkened version of GruvBox on a 81x25 Microsoft
  Terminal from which I ssh into "anton" (my local Ubuntu Server vm in
  VirtualBox named in honor of Gilfoyle) and run nested TMUX. Font is
  28p Ubuntu Mono with wrap set to 72 column. I used to do transparent
  background for streaming but it was murder on my eyes.

color: *terminal
font: *terminal

schedule: &schedule >-
  🕐 https://twitch.tv/rwxrob/schedule I don't have any sort of schedule
  except Saturdays 12-5pm and Sundays 12-3pm for Beginner Boost (!boost)
  stuff. The rest is really random but almost always HackerYoga music
  and !coding, hacking, and !coworking. I'm in US Easter Time zone. !about

sponsor: >-
  🙏 https://github.com/sponsors/rwxrob Thank you for sponsoring with
  subs and follows and bits, but preferred sponsorship is through GitHub
  where you will get recognition as well for being a FOSS supporter.
  Money I get frees me up to make more software and content including
  traveling to conferences and covering them for the community.

commands: &commands >-
  ❗ https://github.com/rwxrob/rwxrob/blob/main/twitch/commands.yaml If
  you see a command I'm missing (or a typo) go ahead and make a PR (if
  you like). Eventually, I hope to render this file as a single,
  relative-hyperlinked web page so people can navigate it without
  Twitch.

cmds: *commands

shell: &shell >-
  💻 I live on the !bash Linux shell (as do most hackers and
  infrastructure engineers, !work). A "shell" is technically any program
  that interfaces with a user to pass on commands to the
  operating system. Most shells use a !repl

bash: >-
  💻 bash is the default Linux !shell and the most powerful shell
  currently in existence. It's in my top five favorite !codelangs of all
  time. It's `complete -C` is madatory for any reasonable modern tab
  completion (!bonzai). BTW, Make sure to use !shellcheck when writing
  *any* shell script and !RTFM if you want to learn it.

rtfm: &rtfm >-
  😎📖 READ THE FUCKING MANUAL! (man man) This is the best way to get
  solid answers for !UNIX and !Linux and the *only* way to truly learn
  !bash. NOT doing this is one thing that distinguishes !hackers from
  normies. Hackers read shit: Whitepapers, !RFCs, man pages, source code
  for fun. These are your bibles. Learn to love them. And stop reading
  Reddit and Dev.to.

man: *rtfm

shellcheck: >-
  💻 https://www.shellcheck.net is a critical tool that should be used
  on *every* !shell script every written. Shell scripts are notoriously
  buggy and unsafe. This is the only way to be 100% sure you are okay.
  Plus there is an exhaustive wiki with descriptions of all the
  potential errors.

zsh: >-
  💩 zsh is the default !shell on Mac cuz Apple steals from !FOSS, not
  because it's better.  Zsh is, in fact, inferior to !bash and
  dangerously encouraging floating point math which is NOT !POSIX.
  !Bonzai completion fails on zsh because zsh does not support minimal
  `complete -C` completion.

repl: >-
  A "read, evaluate, print, loop" is what you get when you are prompted
  to enter a command or data and then something happens and you are
  prompted again. !bash is a REPL. https://repl.it is a service that
  focuses on this.

zet: >-
  📃 https://github.com/rwxrob/zet My "zettelkasten" repo where I brain
  dump everything with little attention to grammar, spelling, and
  political correctness. You've been warned. Eventually, this will
  become a part of my !KEG node.

afk: "/me 🐟 {user.name} is afk"

fluff: >-
  ⛅ https://github.com/rwxrob/fluff Happy little clouds at home, on
  your desktop, in VirtualBox or VMware.

pegn: >-
  🔥 https://pegn.dev I created the Parsing Expression Grammar Notation
  (PEGN) (inspired by Brian Ford's PEG) for expressing any grammar in
  a way that is easy to parse cognitively and programmatically without
  any specific application or implementation in mind. It builds on the
  best of existing meta and data structure languages such as PEG, ABNF,
  EBNF, and JSON.

lang: >-
  🌎 I am a native English speaker but went to college for Russian and
  lived in Russia and Ukraine for a few years. I also served a Mormon
  mission to the French West Indies where I learned French and Creole.
  I would really love to learn Mandarin and German and Spanish and
  Portuguese eventually. Also see !codelangs

rust: >-
  💩 I hate Rust, the syntax is ugly, the mod team resigned in disgust
  over "hypocrisy" of the governance board, PhDs have done
  dissertations on how Rust "safety" is a lie, and nothing substantial
  (like Docker or Kubernetes) has ever been made in Rust. Maybe that's
  why there are virtually no jobs for it. Meanwhile, !go blows Rust away
  for the things which matter most and has tons of projects and !jobs.

distro: >-
  💻 I run Ubuntu Server running in VirtualBox on both Windows desktop,
  and Mac laptop. Personally, after running a Linux desktop for more
  than a decade I want nothing to do with Linux desktops. Most people
  cannot run Linux desktops at work, and I want to help *them*. Plus,
  I stream and Streamlabs is essential software and only works on
  Windows or Mac.

learn: >-
  ⚡ Stuff you should learn: 1) learn like a !hacker 2) !Linux terminal
  3) !Vim editing with !UNIX !filters 4) !bash scripting 5) !Go
  programming 6) !Markdown and !Pandoc 7) !Git and !GitHub 8) minimal
  !web publishing (!HTML/!CSS/!JS) 9) !Docker !containers 10) text-based
  !search with !lynx 11) !C for understanding 12) !python 13) !perl 14)
  Kubernetes (!k8s)

streamlabs: >-
  💡 I fucking love Streamlabs. Just the video clip publisher and
  message highlighter are worth every penny. I don't care that they
  didn't mention OBS and changed their name. It is an *amazing* product
  that has saved me so much time writing my own stuff I can't even
  calculate it.

hacker: &hacker >-
  😎💻 Hacking is a mind-set. Hackers figures shit out on their own,
  !autodidacts who make stuff do what they want in unexpected ways.
  Hackers learn more about stuff than the original creators. That's
  really it. Hackers are, therefore, pragmatic scientists in the truest
  sense. They !rwx their way though life for fun and profit. Hack the
  planet! You'll be glad you did.

hackers: *hacker

irc: >-
  💬 Internet Relay Chat is the first real messaging system that worked
  across the network. It is still very popular with !hackers and is the
  basis for all Twitch chat. That's right. You don't need Twitch. You
  can just use IRC. Look for "Twitch Without the Twitch" on my
  https://twitch.tv/rwxrob/about page.

cowork: &cowork >-
  🤔 Coworking is like you are sitting next to me working on something
  of your own. Occasionally, we'll take a break and chat, rant, or
  share.  The HackerYoga !music is usually always on, even when I'm AFK.
  Why am I SO busy? There's a lot wrong with the world and I try to
  follow the creed: don't get mad, get busy. Now let's get some shit
  done, together.
