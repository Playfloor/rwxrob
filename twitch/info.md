# remote

💻📞 I've been working 100% remote since 2000. I was hired as fully
remote by !IBM after I was head-hunted by a recruiter out of !Nike.
Working remotely requires strong separation of your work environment
from your living space, usually. After 20 years I'm okay mixing the two.
Most can't. I plan on working from the road and !irl !twitch streaming
in 2022 at some point.
